# To-Do:
## Fix buttons in login and signup forms

## Connect lists to users
  - users have many lists
  - list belongs_to a user

  - add migration user id to lists
  - when a logged in user creates a list, that list should be associated with that user.
  - user should be able to see only her lists

## Other
  - layout pages add links, back to all lists
  - except for the links page
